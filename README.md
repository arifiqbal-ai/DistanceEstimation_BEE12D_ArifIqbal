# DistanceEstimation_BEE12D_ArifIqbal

This computer vision project focuses on the implementation of depth estimation through stereo vision using a carefully calibrated stereo camera pair. The objective is to enhance the spatial understanding of the environment by accurately calculating the distance to objects in a scene. The stereo camera setup consists of two synchronized cameras with a strategically chosen baseline, allowing for the exploitation of binocular disparity to infer depth information. The project encompasses several key components, including stereo camera calibration, image rectification through homography transformations, and the computation of depth maps using OpenCV. The calibration process ensures the accurate alignment of the stereo cameras, crucial for precise depth calculations. Image rectification, achieved through homography, is employed to rectify the stereo images, simplifying the correspondence matching process. Depth maps are generated by calculating disparities between corresponding points in the rectified stereo images. OpenCV's stereo module is utilized to implement efficient and accurate algorithms for this purpose, leveraging both block-matching techniques and advanced machine learning-based approaches.
